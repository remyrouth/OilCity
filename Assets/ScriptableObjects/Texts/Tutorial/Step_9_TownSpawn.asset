  dialogueTextEnglish: 'Perfect it seems like people have started to move into town
    this is likely due to the higher worker satisfaction as the better it is the
    more likely people are to move in. Which is incredible because it means we are
    helping the people here. Now I don''t expect this to have to be the case but
    if a house is in your way that you really need to remove. You can pay the family
    to move out and remove their house. However no one in the community would like
    that.
